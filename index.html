<h1>Metacentrism Orientation Test</h1>
 <h3> The goal of that test is to identify your current position on the Metacentrist Plane.<br>
The test explores how you tend to act across different situations.<br>
There are no correct answers.<br>
Choose the option that best reflects what you would actually do if you were put in the described situation right now, not what you think you should generally do.<br>
It's best to go with your first reaction.

  <h2>How to read the plane</h2>

  <h3>Material ↔ Ideal</h3>

  <p>
    <strong>Material.</strong><br>
    Consciousness is determined by material conditions.
    Physical comfort, money, bodily needs, and living conditions form the primary basis
    for values, decisions, and priorities.
  </p>

  <p>
    At moderate levels, this appears as a practical, grounded orientation toward everyday life,
    where stability, work, and tangible well-being are treated as central.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Ideal.</strong><br>
    Consciousness is guided by ideas, principles, and meanings.
    Material comfort can be neglected or subordinated for the sake of values,
    beliefs, or purpose.
  </p>

  <p>
    At moderate levels, this appears as principled, value-driven living,
    where actions are justified primarily by what is considered right, true, or meaningful.
  </p>

  <h3>Egocentric ↔ Depersonalized</h3>

  <p>
    <strong>Egocentric.</strong><br>
    The self is asserted over others.
    The individual actively imposes their will, views, or conditions,
    often treating their own perspective as primary or superior.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Depersonalized.</strong><br>
    The self is minimized or absent.
    The individual does not consciously assert agency and mainly reacts to impulses,
    circumstances, or external forces.
  </p>

  <h3>Metaxis</h3>

  <p>
    Neither domination nor dissolution of the self — a <strong>conscious state</strong>.<br>
    Neither material reduction nor ideal abstraction — an <strong>integral state</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Metaxis represents a mode of being in which agency is present without coercion,
    and meaning is held without detachment from reality.
